Quickly I verified for exploratory, accessibility, basic penetration and load test.

Below is the report for the same.

URL:http://hotel-test.equalexperts.io/
Browser: Google Chrome version 77.1

Scenario 1:

Add record by leaving either all the fields or any one field blank

Test result: not allowed to add record with empty field

Scenario 2:

Add record with price = alphanumeric (example: asad12)

Test result: Not allowed to add the record when price is alphanumeric, which is correct.

Scenario 3: 

Add same data multiple times with no change (tied 7 times to add same data)

Example:
First name = test
Last name = test
Price=1
Deposit = true
Check in = 2019-09-09
Check out = 2019-09-30

Test result: All the times record added, there is no field which uniquely identifies each row. Needs some more clarity regarding adding duplicate records.

Scenario 4: Add Check in date after the checkout date

Example: 

Check in = 2019-09-09
Check out = 2019-08-30

Test result: Record successfully added. There should be validation to check check in date is on or before checkout date.

Scenario 5: 
Add first name and surname with numeric fields
Add first name = 1213232, surname = 1232323 and price = 1.00 
Deposit = true
Check in = 2019-09-09
Check out = 2019-09-30

Test result: Successfully added the record, there should be a validation present for name fields when we enter only numbers.

Scenario 6: 

Check the calender while selecting the checkout and check in dates.

Test result: Check in and checkout calender, date selection option is available for all the dates including previous dates.

There should be functionality to disable date which is less than current date, which is missing right now.

Scenario 7: Check max limit for all the fields.

Add First name, surname and price field with maximum value.

Test result: There is no max length fixed for these fields and accepts any length of data.
When longer value is added to above fields, and create the record, display is overlapping with one another.

Accessibility testing:
Verified using Axe-core(4.0) plugin

There are 10 error found and the web page is not meet the Web accessibility standards.

1. Ensures every form element has a label - same issue exists for 6 form elements.

Example: <input id="firstname" class="input">

2. Ensures every HTML document has a lang attribute

3. Ensures the document has only one main landmark and each iframe in the page has at most one main landmark

4. Ensures all page content is contained by landmarks

Basic penetration test:
1. Crosssite scripting: Not handled.

Tried to add script <b onmouseover=alert('Wufff!')>click me!</b> in first name and surname field. Successfully added the data and giving mouse over alert.

Tried to add script <img src="http://url.to.file.which/not.exist" onerror=alert(document.cookie);> in first name and surname. Added the record successfully and giving dis[playing the alert.


Load test:

Add record request finished with in 500 ms where less number of records(25 records) present.
It is worth checking load under different time frame and more number of users as it is citizen facing application.
